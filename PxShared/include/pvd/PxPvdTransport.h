\brief	PxPvdTransport is an interface representing the data transport mechanism.
This class defines all services associated with the transport: configuration, connection, reading, writing etc.
It is owned by the application, and can be realized as a file or a socket (using one-line PxDefault<...> methods in
PhysXExtensions) or in a custom implementation. This is a class that is intended for use by PVD, not by the
application, the application entry points are PxPvd and PvdClient.
