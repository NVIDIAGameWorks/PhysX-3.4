/**
\brief A precomputed pruning structure to accelerate scene queries against newly added actors.

The pruning structure can be provided to #PxScene:: addActors() in which case it will get merged
directly into the scene query optimization AABB tree, thus leading to improved performance when
doing queries against the newly added actors. This applies to both static and dynamic actors.

\note PxPruningStructure objects can be added to a collection and get serialized.
\note Adding a PxPruningStructure object to a collection will also add the actors that were used to build the pruning structure.

\note PxPruningStructure must be released before its rigid actors.
\note PxRigidBody objects can be in one PxPruningStructure only.
\note Changing the bounds of PxRigidBody objects assigned to a pruning structure that has not been added to a scene yet will 
invalidate the pruning structure. Same happens if shape scene query flags change or shape gets removed from an actor.
