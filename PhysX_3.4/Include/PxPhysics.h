/**
\brief Creates an instance of the physics SDK.

Creates an instance of this class. May not be a class member to avoid name mangling.
Pass the constant PX_PHYSICS_VERSION as the argument.
There may be only one instance of this class per process. Calling this method after an instance 
has been created already will result in an error message and NULL will be returned.

Calling this will register all optional code modules (Articulations, HeightFields, Cloth 
and Particles), preparing them for use.  If you do not need some of these modules, consider
calling PxCreateBasePhysics() instead and registering needed modules manually.  If you would
like to use the unified heightfield collision code instead, it is permitted to follow this call
with a call to ::PxRegisterUnifiedHeightFields().
