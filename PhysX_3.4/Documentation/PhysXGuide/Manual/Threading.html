<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter explains how to use PhysX in multithreaded applications. There are three main aspects to using PhysX with multiple threads:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>how to make read and write calls into the PhysX API from multiple threads without causing race conditions.</li>
<li>how to use multiple threads to accelerate simulation processing.</li>
<li>how to perform asynchronous simulation, and read and write to the API while simulation is being processed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-access-from-multiple-threads">
<span id="dataaccessrules"></span><h2>Data Access from Multiple Threads<a class="headerlink" href="#data-access-from-multiple-threads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For efficiency reasons, PhysX does not internally lock access to its data structures by the application, so be careful when calling the API from multiple application threads. The rules are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>API interface methods marked 'const' are read calls, other API interface methods are write calls.</li>
<li>API read calls may be made simultaneously from multiple threads.</li>
<li>Objects in different scenes may be safely accessed by different threads.</li>
<li>Different objects outside a scene may be safely accessed from different threads. Be aware that accessing an object may indirectly cause access to another object via a persistent reference (such as joints and actors referencing one another, an actor referencing a shape, or a shape referencing a mesh.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Access patterns which do not conform to the above rules may result in data corruption, deadlocks, or crashes. Note in particular that it is not legal to perform a write operation on an object in a scene concurrently with a read operation to an object in the same scene. The checked build contains code which tracks access by application threads to objects within a scene, to try and detect problems at the point when the illegal API call is made.</p>
<div class="section" id="scene-locking">
<h3>Scene Locking<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-locking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each PxScene object provides a multiple reader, single writer lock that can be used to control access to the scene by multiple threads. This is useful for situations where the PhysX scene is
shared between more than one system, for example APEX and a game engine's physics code. The scene lock provides a way for these systems to coordinate with each other.</p>
<p>It is not mandatory to use the lock. If all access to the scene is from a single thread, using the lock adds unnecessary overhead. Even if you are accessing the scene from multiple threads, you may be able to synchronize the threads using a simpler or more efficient application-specific mechanism that guarantees your application meets the above conditions. However, using the scene lock has two potential benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the <em>PxSceneFlag::eREQUIRE_RW_LOCK</em> is set, the checked build will issue a warning for any API call made without first acquiring the lock, or if a write call is made when the lock has only been acquired for read,</li>
<li>The APEX SDK uses the scene lock to ensure that it shares the scene safely with your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four methods for for acquiring / releasing the lock:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">PxScene</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">lockRead</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PxU32</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">PxScene</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">unlockWrite</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Additionally there is an RAII helper class to manage these locks, see PxSceneLock.h.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="locking-semantics">
<h3>Locking Semantics<a class="headerlink" href="#locking-semantics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are precise rules regarding the usage of the scene lock:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Multiple threads may read at the same time.</li>
<li>Only one thread may write at a time, no thread may write if any threads are reading.</li>
<li>If a thread holds a write lock then it may call both read and write API methods.</li>
<li>Re-entrant read locks are supported, meaning a <em>lockRead()</em> on a thread that has already acquired a read lock is permitted. Each <em>lockRead()</em> must have a paired <em>unlockRead()</em>.</li>
<li>Re-entrant write locks are supported, meaning a <em>lockWrite()</em> on a thread that has already acquired a write lock is permitted. Each <em>lockWrite()</em> must have a paired <em>unlockWrite()</em>.</li>
<li>Calling <em>lockRead()</em> by a thread that has already acquired the write lock is permitted and the thread will continue to have read and write access. Each lock*() must have an associated unlock*() that occurs in reverse order.</li>
<li>Lock upgrading is <em>not</em> supported - a <em>lockWrite()</em> by a thread that has already acquired a read lock is <em>not</em> permitted. Attempting this in checked builds will result in an error, in release builds it will lead to deadlock.</li>
<li>Writers are favored - if a thread attempts a <em>lockWrite()</em> while the read lock is acquired it will be blocked until all readers leave. If new readers arrive while the writer thread is blocked they will be put to sleep and the writer will have first chance to access the scene. This prevents writers being starved in the presence of multiple readers.</li>
<li>If multiple writers are queued then the first writer will receive priority, subsequent writers will be granted access according to OS scheduling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <em>PxScene::release()</em> automatically attempts to acquire the write lock, it is not necessary to acquire it manually before calling release().</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="locking-best-practices">
<h3>Locking Best Practices<a class="headerlink" href="#locking-best-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is often useful to arrange your application to acquire the lock a single time to perform multiple operations. This minimizes the overhead of the lock, and in addition can prevent cases such as a sweep test in one thread seeing a rag doll that has been only partially inserted by another thread.</p>
<p>Clustering writes can also help reduce contention for the lock, as acquiring the lock for write will stall any other thread trying to perform a read access.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asynchronous-simulation">
<h2>Asynchronous Simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#asynchronous-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PhysX simulation is asynchronous by default. Start simulation by calling:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">scene</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">simulate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dt</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When this call returns, the simulation step has begun in a separate thread. While simulation is running, you can still make calls into the API. Where those calls affect simulation state, the results will be buffered and reconciled with the simulation results when the simulation step completes.</p>
<p>To wait until simulation completes, call:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">scene</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">fetchResults</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The boolean parameter to fetchResults denotes whether the call should wait for simulation to complete, or return immediately with the current completion status. See the API documentation for more detail.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish two time slots for data access:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>After the call to <em>PxScene::fetchResults()</em> has returned and before the next <em>PxScene::simulate()</em> call (see figure below, blue area &quot;1&quot;).</li>
<li>After the call to <em>PxScene::simulate()</em> has returned and before the corresponding <em>PxScene::fetchResults()</em> call (see figure below, green area &quot;2&quot;).</li>
</ol>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/timeSlots.png"><img alt="../_images/timeSlots.png" src="../_images/timeSlots.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<p>In the first time slot, the simulation is not running and there are no restrictions for reading or writing object properties. Changes to the position of an object, for example, are applied instantaneously and the next scene query or simulation step will take the new state into account.</p>
<p>In the second time slot the simulation is running and in the process, reading and changing the state of objects. Concurrent access from the user might corrupt the state of the objects or lead to data races or inconsistent views in the simulation code. Hence the simulation code's view of the objects is protected from API writes, and any attributes the simulation updates are buffered to allow API reads. The consequences will be discussed in detail in the next section.</p>
<p>Note that <em>simulate()</em> and <em>fetchResults()</em> are write calls on the scene, and as such it is illegal to access any object in the scene while these functions are running.</p>
<div class="section" id="double-buffering">
<span id="doublebuffering"></span><h3>Double Buffering<a class="headerlink" href="#double-buffering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While a simulation is running, PhysX supports read and write access to objects in the scene (with some exceptions, see further below). This includes adding/removing them to/from a scene.</p>
<p>From the user perspective, API changes are reflected immediately. For example, if the velocity of a rigid body is set and then queried, the new velocity will be returned. Similarly, if an object is created while the simulation is running, it can be accessed/modified as any other object. However, these changes are buffered so that the simulation code sees the object state as it was when <em>PxScene::simulate()</em> was called.  For instance, changes to the filter data of an object while the simulation is running are ignored for collision pair generation of the running step, and will only affect for the next simulation step.</p>
<p>When  <em>PxScene::fetchResults()</em> is called, any buffered changes are flushed: changes made by the simulation are reflected in API view of the objects, and API changes are made visible to the simulation code for the next step. User changes take precedence: for example, a user change to the position of an object while the simulation is running will overwrite the position which resulted from the simulation.</p>
<p>The delayed application of updates does not affect scene queries, which always take into account the latest changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="events-involving-removed-objects">
<h3>Events involving removed objects<a class="headerlink" href="#events-involving-removed-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Deleting objects or removing them from the scene while the simulation is in process will affect the simulation events sent out at <em>PxScene::fetchResults()</em>. The behavior is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>PxSimulationEventCallback::onWake(), ::onSleep()</em> events will not get fired if an object is involved which got deleted/removed during the running simulation.</li>
<li><em>PxSimulationEventCallback::onContact(), ::onTrigger()</em> events will get fired if an object is involved which got deleted/removed during the running simulation. The deleted/removed object will be marked as such (see <em>PxContactPairHeaderFlag::eREMOVED_ACTOR_0</em>, <em>PxContactPairFlag::eREMOVED_SHAPE_0, PxTriggerPairFlag::eREMOVED_SHAPE_TRIGGER</em>). Furthermore, if <em>PxPairFlag::eNOTIFY_TOUCH_LOST, ::eNOTIFY_THRESHOLD_FORCE_LOST</em> events were requested for the pair containing the deleted/removed object, then these events will be created.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support">
<h3>Support<a class="headerlink" href="#support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Not all PhysX objects have full buffering support. Operations which can not run while the simulation is in process are mentioned in the API documentation and the SDK aborts such operations and reports an error. The most important exceptions are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Particles: The particle bulk data can not be read or modified while the simulation is running, this includes operations like reading/writing particle positions/velocities, creating/deleting particles, adding forces, etc.</li>
<li>Cloth: The only allowed double buffered operation is to create/delete a cloth and add/remove it to/from the scene.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="memory-considerations">
<h3>Memory Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The buffers to store the object changes while the simulation is running are created on demand. If memory usage concerns outweigh the advantage of reading/writing objects in parallel with simulation, do not write to objects while the simulation is running.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multithreaded-simulation">
<span id="taskman"></span><h2>Multithreaded Simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#multithreaded-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PhysX includes a task system for managing CPU and GPU compute resources. Tasks are created with dependencies so
that they are resolved in a given order, when ready they are then submitted to a
user-implemented dispatcher for execution.</p>
<p>Middleware products typically do not want to create CPU threads for their
own use.  This is especially true on consoles where execution threads
can have significant overhead. In the task model, the computational
work is broken into jobs that are submitted to the game's thread pool as
they become ready to run.</p>
<p>The following classes comprise the CPU task management.</p>
<div class="section" id="taskmanager">
<h3>TaskManager<a class="headerlink" href="#taskmanager" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A TaskManager manages inter-task dependencies and dispatches ready tasks
to their respective dispatcher. There is a dispatcher for CPU tasks and
GPU tasks assigned to the TaskManager.</p>
<p>TaskManagers are owned and created by the SDK. Each PxScene will allocate
its own TaskManager instance which users can configure with dispatchers
through either the PxSceneDesc or directly through the TaskManager interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cpudispatcher">
<h3>CpuDispatcher<a class="headerlink" href="#cpudispatcher" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The CpuDispatcher is an abstract class the SDK uses for interfacing with the
application's thread pool. Typically, there will be one single
CpuDispatcher for the entire application, since there is rarely a need
for more than one thread pool. A CpuDispatcher instance may be shared by
more than one TaskManager, for example if multiple scenes are being used.</p>
<p>PhysX includes a default CpuDispatcher implementation, but we prefer
applications to implement this class themselves so PhysX and APEX can
efficiently share CPU resources with the application.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The TaskManager will call CpuDispatcher::submitTask() from either the
context of API calls (aka: scene::simulate()) or from other running

<div class="section" id="cpudispatcher-implementation-guidelines">
<h3>CpuDispatcher Implementation Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#cpudispatcher-implementation-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the scene's TaskManager has found a ready-to-run task and submitted it to the
appropriate dispatcher it is up to the dispatcher implementation to decide how and
when the task will be run.</p>
<p>Often in game scenarios the rigid body simulation is time critical and the goal is to
reduce the latency from simulate() to the completion of fetchResults(). The lowest
possible latency will be achieved when the PhysX tasks have exclusive access to CPU resources
during the update. In reality, PhysX will have to share compute resources with other game tasks.
Below are some guidelines to help ensure a balance between throughput and latency when mixing
the PhysX update with other work.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Avoid interleaving long running tasks with PhysX tasks, this will help reduce latency.</li>
<li>Avoid assigning worker threads to the same execution core as higher priority threads. If a PhysX task is context switched during execution the rest of the rigid body pipeline may be stalled, increasing latency.</li>
<li>PhysX occasionally submits tasks and then immediately waits for them to complete, because of this, executing tasks in LIFO (stack) order may perform better than FIFO (queue) order.</li>
<li>PhysX is not a perfectly parallel SDK, so interleaving small to medium granularity tasks will generally result in higher overall throughput.</li>
<li>If your thread pool has per-thread job-queues then queuing tasks on the thread they were submitted may result in more optimal CPU cache coherence, however this is not required.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details see the default CpuDispatcher implementation that comes as part of the
PxExtensions package. It uses worker threads that each have their own task queue and steal
tasks from the back of other worker's queues (LIFO order) to improve workload distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basetask">
<h3>BaseTask<a class="headerlink" href="#basetask" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>BaseTask is the abstract base class for all task types.  All task
run() functions will be executed on application threads, so they
need to be careful with their stack usage, use a little stack as
possible, and they should never block for any reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="task">
<h3>Task<a class="headerlink" href="#task" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Task class is the standard task type. Tasks must be submitted to the
TaskManager each simulation step for them to be executed.  Tasks may be
named at submission time, this allows them to be discoverable.  Tasks
will be given a reference count of 1 when they are submitted, and the
TaskManager::startSimulation() function decrements the reference count
of all tasks and dispatches all Tasks whose reference count reaches zero.
Before TaskManager::startSimulation() is called, Tasks can set
dependencies on each other to control the order in which they are dispatched.
Once simulation has started, it is still possible to submit new tasks and
add dependencies, but it is up to the programmer to avoid race hazards.
You cannot add dependencies to tasks that have already been dispatched,
and newly submitted Tasks must have their reference count decremented
before that Task will be allowed to execute.</p>
<p>Synchronization points can also be defined using Task names. The
TaskManager will assign the name a TaskID with no Task implementation.
When all of the named TaskID's dependencies are met, it will decrement
the reference count of all Tasks with that name.</p>
<p>APEX uses the Task class almost exclusively to manage CPU
resources. The ApexScene defines a number of named Tasks that the
modules use to schedule their own Tasks (ex: start after LOD
calculations are complete, finish before the PhysX scene is stepped).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lightcputask">
<h3>LightCpuTask<a class="headerlink" href="#lightcputask" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>LightCpuTask is another subclass of BaseTask that is explicitly
scheduled by the programmer. LightCpuTasks have a reference count of 1
when they are initialized, so their reference count must be decremented
before they are dispatched. LightCpuTasks increment their continuation
task reference count when they are initialized, and decrement the
reference count when they are released (after completing their run() function)</p>
<p>PhysX 3.x uses LightCpuTasks almost exclusively to manage CPU
resources. For example, each stage of the simulation update may consist
of multiple parallel tasks, when each of these tasks has finished execution
it will decrement the reference count on the next task in the update chain.
This will then be automatically dispatched for execution when its reference
count reaches zero.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Even when using LightCpuTasks exclusively to manage CPU resources, the
TaskManager startSimulation() and stopSimulation() calls must be made
each simulation step to keep the GpuDispatcher synchronized.</p>

<p>The following code snippets show how the crabs' A.I. in SampleSubmarine is run as a CPU Task. By doing so the Crab A.I. is run as a background Task in parallel with the PhysX simulation update.</p>

<p>After PxScene::simulate() has been called, and the simulation started, the application calls removeReference() on each Crab task, this in turn causes it to be submitted to the CpuDispatcher for update. Note that it is also possible to submit tasks to the dispatcher directly (without manipulating reference counts) as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">PxLightCpuTask</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">task</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">mCrab</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">mCpuDispatcher</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">submitTask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">task</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once queued for execution by the CpuDispatcher, one of the thread pool's worker threads will eventually call the task's run method. In this example the Crab task will perform raycasts against the scene and update its internal state machine:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Crab</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// run as a separate task/thread</span>
    <span class="n">scanForObstacles</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="n">updateState</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is safe to perform API read calls, such as scene queries, from multiple threads while simulate() is running. However, care must be taken not to overlap API read and write calls from multiple threads. In this case the SDK will issue an error, see <a class="reference internal" href="#threading"><em>Threading</em></a> for more information.</p>
