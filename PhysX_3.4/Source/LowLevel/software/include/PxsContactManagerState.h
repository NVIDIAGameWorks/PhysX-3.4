	There is an implicit 1:1 mapping between PxgContactManagerInput and PxsContactManagerOutput. The structures are split because PxgNpContactManagerInput contains constant
	data that is produced by the CPU code and PxgNpContactManagerOutput contains per-frame contact information produced by the NP.

	There is also a 1:1 mapping between the PxgNpContactManager and PxsContactManager. This mapping is handled within the PxgNPhaseCore.

	The previous contact states are implicitly cached in PxsContactManager and will be propagated to the solver. Friction correlation is also done implicitly using cached 
	information in PxsContactManager.
	The NP will produce a list of pairs that found/lost patches for the solver along with updating the PxgNpContactManagerOutput for all pairs.
