	Sweeps a sphere against a triangle.

	All input parameters (sphere, triangle, sweep direction) must be in the same space. Sweep length is assumed to be infinite.

	By default, 'testInitialOverlap' must be set to true to properly handle the case where the sphere already overlaps the triangle
	at the start of the sweep. In such a case, returned impact distance is exactly 0.0f. If it is known ahead of time that the sphere
	cannot overlap the triangle at t=0.0, then 'testInitialOverlap' can be set to false to skip the initial overlap test and make the
	function run faster.

	If the ray defined by the sphere's center and the unit direction directly intersects the triangle-related part of the TSS (*) (i.e.
	the prism from the Minkowski sum of the inflated triangle) then 'directHit' is set to true. Otherwise it is set to false.

	(*) For Triangle Swept Sphere, see http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/SSV/ssv.pdf for the origin of these names.
